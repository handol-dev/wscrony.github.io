1. How to efficiently make an appointment with Prof. Wook-Shin Han?
You can see my google calendar shared below, so you can make an appointment by sending a Google calendar appointment request for online or offline meetings. Due to the pandemic, I prefer to discussing through Zoom. 

2. What to prepare for a meeting?
	* a Zoom link (if you want to discuss online)
	* Summary of the last meeting
	* Purpose of the meeting and action items to discuss
	* Future plan
	* Transcript (if you want to apply for graduate student positions)
